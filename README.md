# FoodMetric
Application Code for FoodMetric, a Project created at the MLH-sponsored University of Houston CodeRED Hackathon.

### Notes
When copying the repository, you should externally download the libraries used in the application. Link the libraries to the cloned version through pasting them into the 'libs' folder of the project to prevent errors. Click to download the [GraphView](http://www.android-graphview.org/) and [AChartEngine](http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/a/Downloadachartengine100jar.htm) libraries (this project utilizes GraphView version 4.2.1 and AChartEngine version 1.0.0).
